    "For this workshop, the Azure Data Science Virtual Machine will be used.  This is a VM one can fire up on Azure to perform data science tasks and is pre-installed with dozens of frameworks and packages for use.  It's a nice way to get started quickly without much overhead/setup which is one of the reasons we chose this for the workshop.  [Find out more here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/data-science-virtual-machine/overview).\n",
    "\n",
    "You will get credentials for a machine and log in at the URL provided.  This will be the jupyter notebook environment/playground provided to you for the day.  At the **end of the day you should zip up your notebooks and download** them as these VMs will disappear shortly thereafter into the sunset.  Be sure you are using `https`.  You may get a \"Your Connection is Not Private\" or other form of safety certificate error.  This is a known issue and we are working on it.  Please click through this by hitting the link on the page to continue."
